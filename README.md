🌟Task 3- Text Generation using Markov Chains 

💡Project Highlight:

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of **text generation using Markov chains**, a statistical method to generate new text by predicting the next word based on the previous one. It's part of a Generarive AI internship task.

📝 Introduction 

Markov Chains are used for **text generation** by building a probabilistic model based on training text. It predicts the next word based on previous word, creating Coherent text that mimics the Style of source data.

⚙ How It works 

🔹️ The model analyzes a training dataset
🔹️ It creates a **transition matrix** mapping each word to the possible next words.
🔹️ It randomly selects a starting word and continues generating text by choosing the next word based on probabilities.

🛠 Technologies used:

Python 

NLTK 

NumPy
